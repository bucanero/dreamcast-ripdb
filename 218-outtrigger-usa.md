This is for a selbooting game! Dont use hack3, or dahack etc. Also, common sega, give us some real mean protection to crack, this is just easy, the only game youve given us with real mean protection was stupid invadors, and that werent worth the cracking time. MSR & Jetset radio were just more lamers like this!
