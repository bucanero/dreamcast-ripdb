## Downsampling

select *.4xm video you want to delete (install 4xm player and encoder), (prefer the short video). Make a fake 4xm short video with blank sound, and replace the the files you want to delete with it. (you must reduce - 230Mo to make a selfboot cd)<br />Or if you prefer replace just one video file and downsample audio file (but i don't  know how)
