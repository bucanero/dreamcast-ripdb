## Rip Details

- **Status:** Great... the intro was very hard to notice the difference in quality. The only problem is it takes about 20 seconds to get past the second start up screen that says S**A liscense crap

## Downsampling

Every ADX file to mono<br />2 sfd files almost unnoticably less quality, but half the size

## Bin Hacking

Hack3, may be unneeded<br /><br />Binhack of course<br /><br />

## Comments
