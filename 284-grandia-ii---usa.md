## Downsampling

<br /> Gr2.afs downsamped to 11025, Left Channel only. ~78mb<br /><br />Downsampled all SFD to 22050, Left Channel only.<br />I do not exactly remember, but I believe that I downsampled the video to 2100kbits/sec.<br />

## Comments

<br /> You need to divide this game into two discs.<br />1st Disc in dir.<br />LOGO\ leave SFD's cg01.sfd- cg10.sfd<br /><br />2nd disc, copy eveything from disc 1 but in dir.<br />LOGO\ delete SFD's cg01.sfd-cg08.sfd.<br />There should only be SFD's cg09.sfd - cg17a.sfd<br /><br />The swap point between the two cds is when you land on the moon. <br />Save the game, then shut off the system, put in the 2nd cd and load your saved game then play to the end of the game.<br /><br />~I believe that it may be possible to place this game on one cd if the SFD's were to be extremely downsampled,<br />but the quality would be horrible.
