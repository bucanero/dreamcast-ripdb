## Downsampling

All music files (adxxxxx.bin) filesize to 0<br />didn't make it selfboot because with the music files set to 0, the iso size is still 688 MB, not enuff for selfboot on 700 MB CDR.

## Bin Hacking

## Comments

don't press any buttons and the demos and so on will run fine (w/o the music of course), but if you press a button during that cycle, the screen will hang and you'll hear "Capcom Vs. SNK - Millenium Fight 2000" -- and that's it. Maybe it MUST be selfboot, or maybe i hacked the program binaries wrong. Anyone who's getting this tihs to work drop your knowledge right here please.
