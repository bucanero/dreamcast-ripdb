## Downsampling

None really... It was a bit on the large side so, but i put my own .Wavs in which i enjoy anyway. It fit after that. Just remember the wavs are burnt in the first session, as track 4- one before last track... use your small audio.raw or .wav for the first 3, and blank audio for any other tracks you like, dont worry... the audio is used in gameplay and a track is skipped after its finished.

## Bin Hacking

Used Hack3<br /><br />later i did another rip that and it only needed binhack<yey>

## Comments

Pretty easy, lots of audio tracks though
