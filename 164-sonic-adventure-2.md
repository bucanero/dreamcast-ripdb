## Downsampling

downsampled 5 sfd files.   I then had to fix those files because they used a new  multiplexer made by sega.  <br />I also changed all adx files to mono.  I downsampled a few to 22050 htz.  Also had to loop all adx files.  (takes forever)

## Bin Hacking

dahack 1st_read.bin, 2_dp.bin, sg_dpldr.bin, maigo.bin<br />also in 1st_read.bin -  change cde4 436a to 0900 0900<br />and also chane 1032 00d8b to 0800 od8b

## Comments

my previous release of this game had problems with all the sfd files. sfd's that were downsampled need to be downsampled by a new sega multiplexer.
