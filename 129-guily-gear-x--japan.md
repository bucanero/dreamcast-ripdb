- **Status:** "Successful"- Selfbootable<br />!!!BUT!!! <br />as you go begin a match, you are unable to move your characters and the screen freezes.

## Downsampling

Removed a couple of the cdda audio files and replaced them with wav files that are 4-6 seconds of silence.

## Bin Hacking

dahack: <br />1st_read.bin <2nd Msinfo><br />Sg_dpldr.bin <2nd Msinfo><br />2_dp.bin <2nd Msinfo><br /><br />then apply:<br />CDDA 1st_read.bin<br /><br />=== unable to hack Maigo.bin because there is a different extension, something like Maigo.14x====<br /><br /><br />

## Comments

I have tried many methods. <br />1) Selfboot (with and without cdda)<br />2) Bootdisc (remove cdda)<br />3) 1st session is game, 2nd session is the header.iso or boot file.<br /><br />Still unsuccessful, they boot up fine, but as you begin a fight, you are unable to move the characters and then it freezes.<br /><br />
