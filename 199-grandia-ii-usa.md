- **Status:** Unsuccesful.<br />I'm about to give up on this game. Played the single player a bit, but it wasn't that great.  Was able to get to the title screen, but the game would freeze at the loading screen and after the intro in a new game.

## Downsampling

Gr2.afs --> 87 mb.<br />This game is huge 950mb.<br />Echelon split the video's in the logo on 2 cd's.<br />The iso ends up being about 675 mb

## Comments

From my experience with this game so far, it isn't worth it.
