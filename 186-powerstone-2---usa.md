- **Status:** Succesful. I get the occasional freeze which may or may not be a result of not using dahack and dummy files. This was my first rip :) . It was easy and I reccomend it for beginners.

## Downsampling

None needed.

## Bin Hacking

Just the standard hack (hack.exe) on 1st_read.bin, Magio.bin, 2_dp.bin, and Sg_Dpldr.bin. I forgot to use dahack.exe, but it seems to work without it. No dummy files used.

## Comments

Fun Game.
