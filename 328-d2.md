## Rip Details

- **User:** Hykan
- **Date:** 2005-09-25 18:43:01
- **Status:** The game has been ripped and tested to be 100% working

## Downsampling

The game is too big to fit even on a 99min CDR. Something have to be<br />
downsampled:<br />
<br />
All the *.AFS have to be downsampled to Mono (22050Hz wont work) to fit the<br />
disks on 99min CDR. The movies may have to be dwonsampled too.  Its also<br />
important to arrange small files and movies (.sfd and .m1v)(and avoid<br />
.pvm,.stm,.stn sets) so  that they are wriiten to the inner part or a CD<br />
and big files (animated videos) to the outer part of a CD, or else problems<br />
will arise (hangs, reset to  dreamcast main menu etc.)<br />
<br />
The first disk session have to be LBA 45000. Since the  second disk session<br />
alone is not big enough for all the data, the first session  has to be filled<br />
with data too and dummied to the required LBA45000.<br />
It is impossible to fit the game on 80min CDRs.<br />
<br />
Note: What Belokk have done to his release of disk 1 is ripped the ending movie<br />
and downsampled *.AFS to mono AND 22050Hz**, But the game seems to be hard coded<br />
to 44100Hz, hence the crappy sound and resets when the audio ends before the<br />
video.<br />
<br />
Disk 1:WORLDEV.AFS,COMMON.AFS downsampled to mono<br />
Disk 2:WORLDEV.AFS downsampled to mono<br />
      ZR17D11.M1V downsampled from 1199 to 800kbps<br />
Disk 3:WORLDEV.AFS,COMMON.AFS downsampled to mono<br />
      ZDUMMY.M1V downsampled from 1997 to 800kbps (not really necessary)<br />
      The GD is too big to fit on one 99min CDR! The NRyyxxx.xxx files and the<br />
      movies are distrbuted betweet 2 CDRs, 3A & 3B:<br />
        NR18xxx.xxx           Musician's House<br />
        NR19xxx.xxx           Musician's House<br />
        NR20xxx.xxx           Sorceror<br />
        NR21xxx.xxx Disk 3A   Priest House<br />
        NR22xxx.xxx Disk 3A   Musician's room<br />

        ZGM04.SFD   Disk 3B   Laura's second vision<br />
          Note:All the above descriptions are just my wild guess<br />
Disk 4:ZOPG.SFD (opening movie) downsampled from 2419 to 1000kbps<br />


## Bin Hacking

Binhack 1st_read.bin to 45150<br />
if ya dont it wont work <br />
plus burn to 99min cds<br />


## Comments

The images were created with a variation of Echelon's method and hex edited<br />
directly into Nero format without burning to CDR first.
