- **Status:** Success! Nice selfbooter<br />After 15 (!) Coasters<br />Looks like Zhevon's Dreamrip reads shit out of some GD's if you choose the "rip whole gd-rom" function. You should do a filerip then. Don't forget to create the directories! This only works in linux

## Downsampling

Nothing. See notes

## Bin Hacking

bincon 0winceos.bin 1winceos.bin<br />then rename 1winceos.bin to 0winceos.bin<br />after that, binhack and enable "uses Sega OS" in IP.BIN with IP4WIN<br />Additional, change all references in BIO2DC.EXE from roomcut.bi2 and .bi3 to roomcut.bin

## Comments

i think .bi2 and .bi3 are dummy files (they show no differences), so i deleted them and hacked BIO2DC.EXE.
