## Downsampling

All *pcms and *.bgm's to 11200Khz, 16 bit stereo Sound Forge 4.5. Had to rename resulting wav's to *.bgm and *.pcm

## Bin Hacking

Hack3 0 all boot.bin's

## Comments

Try to downsample to 22000Khz 16 bit stereo. Try to use Cool Edit , cuz there's no in between wav to bgm or pcm involved, leaves bgm and pcm headers intact
