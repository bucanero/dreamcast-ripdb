## Rip Details

- **User:** Jonny Thunder
- **Date:** 2001-05-30 06:33:42
- **Status:** Unsuccessful.  Booted up fine, but reset on the "Sega presents" screen (not the initial sega screen). Probably missed something!

## Downsampling

Downsampled all audio files and used patch to overwrite demo movie files (without this, it was 4 Mb over)

## Bin Hacking

Wrote a util to hack all BIN files (I think there were lots of them)

## Comments

none
