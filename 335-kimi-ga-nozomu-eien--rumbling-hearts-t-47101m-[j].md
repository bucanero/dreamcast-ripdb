## Downsampling

You need to downsample SFDs movies to fit it onto 80min CD-R but Id prefer to overwrite DEMO.SFD because with very small blank one because movies are beautifull :)

## Bin Hacking

Patch (with PAL Patcher v.2) Pal Protection 2 point, dont touch Pal Protection 3

## Comments

To get the game work you need to use bigger audio track to start data from 4500 sector (like on GD).
