# Rayman 2 (UK)

## Rip Details

- **User:** Jonny Thunder
- **Date:** 2001-05-24 12:37:59
- **Status:** No problems really.  Load time for first screen was a bit slow, but the original was like that too apparently.

## Downsampling

Ambient audio was huge, so I took the smaller tracks (at random) and overwrote the large ones.

## Bin Hacking

DAHack'ed ALL Bins in the root
