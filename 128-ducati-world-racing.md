## Comments

It is a winceda type game. <br />I dont remember because I ripped this game a while ago,<br />but I believe that I did not modify the audiofiles for the cdda.<br /><br />I just burned all the cdda files after converting them to wav and burned them on a cd with an open session. <br /><br />Then I burned the actual game on finalize session.<br /><br />It seems that I have managed to get the cdda working with the wince game.
